# Saved Queries

Zequel lets you save frequently used queries as bookmarks so you can access them quickly without rewriting them each time.

## Saving a Query

To save the current query:

1. Write your query in the editor.
2. Press **Cmd+S** (macOS) or **Ctrl+S** (Windows/Linux), or click the **Save** icon in the editor toolbar.
3. In the **Save Query** dialog, enter a **name** for the query (required) and an optional **description** to help you identify it later.
4. Click **Save**.

The query is stored locally and associated with the active connection's database type, so it appears in context when you are working with the same kind of database.

## Accessing Saved Queries

Saved queries are listed in the **Saved Queries** section of the sidebar. Click any saved query to load it into a new editor tab, ready to run.

You can also search through your saved queries by typing in the filter field at the top of the sidebar section.

## Editing a Saved Query

To update a saved query:

1. Right-click the query in the sidebar and select **Edit**.
2. Modify the name, description, or SQL content in the dialog that appears.
3. Click **Save** to apply your changes.

Alternatively, after loading a saved query into the editor and making changes, save it again with the same name to overwrite the previous version.

## Deleting a Saved Query

To remove a saved query, right-click it in the sidebar and select **Delete**. You will be asked to confirm before the query is permanently removed.
