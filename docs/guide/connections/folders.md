# Connection Folders

As the number of saved connections grows, folders help you keep them organized. You can group connections by environment (production, staging, development), project, team, or any scheme that fits your workflow.

## Creating a Folder

1. In the sidebar, click the **"New Folder"** button or right-click in an empty area and select **"New Folder"**.
2. Enter a name for the folder.
3. The folder appears in the sidebar, ready for connections to be added.

## Adding Connections to a Folder

### Drag and Drop

Click and drag a connection in the sidebar and drop it onto a folder. The connection moves into that folder.

### When Creating a Connection

When saving a new connection, you can assign it to an existing folder directly from the connection form.

## Renaming a Folder

1. Right-click the folder in the sidebar.
2. Select **"Rename Folder"**.
3. Enter the new name and confirm.

## Deleting a Folder

1. Right-click the folder in the sidebar.
2. Select **"Delete Folder"**.
3. Confirm the deletion.

Deleting a folder removes only the folder itself. Connections inside the folder are moved back to the top level of the sidebar -- they are not deleted.

## Reordering

You can reorder both folders and connections within the sidebar using drag and drop. Drag items to rearrange their position at the top level or within a folder.

## Nesting

Folders exist at a single level. Nesting folders inside other folders is not supported. Each connection can belong to at most one folder.
